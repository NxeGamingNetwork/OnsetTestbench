# OnsetTestbench
[WIP] An Onset script emulator to kind of test scripts before the release of the game.

## Usage
Just run it (`java -jar OnsetTestbench-1.0.jar`) in your server folder.
Currently most of the functions return a static value so your scripts might crash
because of logical errors even if its totally fine.
We are working on getting most parts of the api implemented, but we probably won't implement anything.
If you need anything to be implemented just open an issue and we'll see what we can do for you.
One feature that is planned is a WebUI emulator in the browser using a websocket interface.
